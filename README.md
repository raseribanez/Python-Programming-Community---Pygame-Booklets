# Python-Programming-Community---Pygame-Booklets
The first set of Pygame tutorials I have written 

Linked to my Python Programming Community facebook page:
https://www.facebook.com/PythonProgrammingCommunity/

I go through the basics of Pygame, and in chapter 1 we make a game template,
a blank game that runs...but is basically just a blank window. The idea is that
this template is able to be used to start all Pygame projects.

Chapter 2 builds upon the code from chapter 1. We add a main character/sprite,
and give him the gift of movement using animation techniques.
A lot of topics are covered in these quick and easy to follow booklets.

These tutorials will be organised into chapters.

Each chapter will have a PDF booklet, Source code for the booklet examples
and may have other handy resources for reference
I also do a video for each chapter typing out the code line by line

I want these to be readable and understandable for beginners. So I don't aim to 
confuse the reader with programming jargon alone...so I do still use the jargon
but explain what a particular phrase, or word means in 'human' language.

I hope these are easy to follow for people of all ages.
